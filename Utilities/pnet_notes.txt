See PnetClass.m as an object oriented interface to pnet which incorporates 
some best practices to avoid locking the socket, cleaning up, and reading 
multiple packets

Compiled on linux-64 (ubuntu) using:

mex -O CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -std=c99" pnet.c

Output:
>> mex -O CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -std=c99" pnet.c
